# Numerical-Integration---The-Monte-Carlo-Method
Monte Carlo integration is a method of numerical integration in which a uniform distribution of random numbers between bounds are sampled into the integrand. As more values are sampled, the approximated integral gets closer to the exact value of the actual integral. This method differs greatly from other methods of numerical integration like the rectangular rule and trapezoidal rule that use a deterministic approach - rather Monte Carlo integration employs a non-deterministic approach to solving the integral. Instead of a direct input defining a predictable output, Monte Carlo integration relies on the random probability distribution to greatly define it. In this report, an algorithm to apply Monte Carlo integration will be outlined and then applied to three definite integrals - a one-dimensional Gaussian function, a three dimensional function describing a screened charge distribution, and an improper integral.
